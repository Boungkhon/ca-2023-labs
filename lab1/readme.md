# Lab1

- The main goal of this lab is to compile gem5 and build a simple computer system on it containing a x86 cpu, l1 & l2 cache and memory. The most important point is learning how to build python objects with connections among them, based on m5 libraries.

- The `simple.py` is a minimal prototype comprised of only cpu and memory, and cache are added in `cache.py` and `two_layer.py`.
